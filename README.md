# Phase2--commands

This script will grab the relative volume of a stock (current volume of the day divided by the average volume). You can adjust the average volume as needed. Also, it will find the top most liquid option contracts given a stock and a contract type. It returns a table. 

Currently, I have this data being fed through a discord channel. However, you can change it to display anywhere.
